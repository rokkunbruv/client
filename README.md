# Memorizz-Client
Client side (frontend) of the Memorizz App. Created by following Parts 1 and 2 of the Full Stack MERN Project Tutorial Series.  

### Deployment
The client will be deployed on Netlify, but I am currently facing issues in regards to initializing the client codebase. According to error reports, it is due to the deprecated dependencies `@material-ui/core` and possibly `@material-ui/icons`. I won't address this concern for now as it needs to significantly modify the client codebase due to the need of a new and long-term-supported UI module.

As of now, here is the link to the app:
