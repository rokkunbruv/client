# Memorizz-Client
Client side (frontend) of the Memorizz App. Created by following Parts 1 and 2 of the Full Stack MERN Project Tutorial Series.  

### Deployment
The client is manually deployed on Netlify

I am currently facing issues when building and deploying the client codebase using this repository, specifically in regards to initializing the client codebase. According to error reports, it is due to the deprecated dependencies `@material-ui/core` and possibly `@material-ui/icons`. Netlify did not force install these dependencies, hence the errors. I won't address this concern for now as it needs to significantly modify the client codebase due to the need of a new and long-term-supported UI module, but I'll try to find ways to make Netlify force install these dependencies.
